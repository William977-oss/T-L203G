## [Kennslufræði] Hér er stutt grein úr tímaritinu Science um áhrif upprifjunarnáms á námsárangur undir streituálagi. Lýsið niðurstöðunum í Mynd 1 í greininni í nokkrum orðum.


#### Figure 1 consists of a graph which showed info on students via two subsequent tests with a 25 minute spacer in between, in the first test students who studied using RP (Retrieval Practice) had better results than those using SP (Study Practice) and in the second test they managed to land higher results whilst those who used SP managed to gather a lesser result. 

#### One interesting fact is that stressed participants using RP (Retrieval Practice) managed to score higher to non-stressed participants on the second test.

## [Kennslufræði] Þessi grein fjallar um samanburð á virkri (active) og óvirkri (passive) kennsluaðferð í eðlisfræði í Harvard háskóla. Lesið a.m.k. inngang greinarinnar og skoðið súluritin í Myndum 1 og 2 (Fig. 1 og Fig. 2). Í þessum súluritum koma fyrir hugtökin TOF (Test of Learning) og FOL (Feeling of Learning). Skrifið nokkrar setningar þar sem þið reynið að útskýra hvers vegna fyrstu tvær súlurnar (með skyggðum bakgrunni) í myndunum eru svona ólíkar hinum súlunum.

The chart consists of two seperate graphs both displaying test results of two different methods of studying SP and RP and the stress level of participants. SP (Study Practice) is when you constantly restudy the material in hopes of whereas RP (Retrieval Practice) is when you try and recall the material.

#### The graph consists of two seperate charts, each representing one of the tests both charts seperate the content between those who used SP and RP and also showed the stress level of the participants. SP (Study Practice) is when people restudy material over multiple time, whilst RP (Retrieval Practice) is when instead of trying to force yourself to process the information, you try and recall as much information as you can.

The bars are meant to showcase the stress levels of participants, shaded bars reffered to stressed participants and non-shaded was visualized using light bars. In the later chart it showed that those under stress had better results over those who 

The difference between the two bars with shaded and light backgrounds are to showcase the stress levels of participants, with shaded being stressed participants. The graph showed that non-stressed participants had consistent scores while stressed participants who used RP did better when it came to the second test while participants using SP did worse when underpressure.
